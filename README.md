###Word-Scroll Game!####
Formerly known as Letter Scroll.


#About:

Word Scroll is an intense experience best practiced under supervision by an adult, if you yourself are an adult then by all means, play away! Words fly across the screen, some easy, some hard, and they get faster as you complete them. Be careful and don't get too comfortable, some might tie your fingers together in the attempt to type.

Instructions:

Start Game initiates a turn, if it's the first time you clicked, it will be player 1's turn, try to type as many words as possible and you only have 3 seconds. If you get to 16 words, the round is over and you got a perfect score. If not, the game logs how many words you typed. Click start game afterwards to initiate Player 2's turn, the words are randomized on each players turn so that player 2 doesn't have an advantage. In the event of a tie, the game is set up to where you can just keep playing until one player wins! New Round button resets the game so you can start a new round.

#Some notes about bugs/needing to be cleaned up and possible improvements:

It could definitely use some more CSS sprucing up, but I'm at a loss as to how to style things. I just splashed some gray and let it go, I figure there is beauty in simplicity. The word bank is a bit small, and maybe I could have used more, but the first time player will find the game challenging, and only after several plays will you run across every word, which I expect nobody will. The fit and finish isn't the best, but I like it in it's current form... so yeah.
